                         DEPLOYMENT TIMELINE
================================================================================

PREPARATION PHASE (15-30 minutes)
  [ ] Read RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md documentation
  [ ] Prepare Supabase credentials
  [ ] Prepare Anthropic API key
  [ ] Test locally with: bash run_local.sh

DEPLOYMENT PHASE (2-5 minutes)
  [ ] Push code to GitHub
  [ ] Create Railway project
  [ ] Configure environment variables
  [ ] Deploy via: bash DEPLOY.sh production
       OR via Railway dashboard

VALIDATION PHASE (5-10 minutes)
  [ ] Verify health check: curl /health

                         COST ESTIMATE
================================================================================

MONTHLY OPERATIONAL COST
  Memory (512MB):      $5.00/month
  CPU (1 core):        Included
  Bandwidth (free):    500GB/month free
  Storage:             None needed
  
  TOTAL:               $5-15/month (for moderate usage)

SCALING COSTS
  Increase to 1GB:     +$5/month
  Add replica:         +$10/month
  
COST OPTIMIZATION
  Use 256MB RAM:       Save $2.50/month
  2 workers instead 4: Save CPU time
  Pause during offpeak: Save significantly
